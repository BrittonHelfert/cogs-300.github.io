# Biomechanics
We can use simple machines, kinematics, and mechanical linkages to analyze our [biomechanics](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/humanbiomechanics/). For example, a simple [model of the human arm](https://www.pasco.com/products/lab-apparatus/mechanics/human-applications/human-arm-model) can be made with a [lever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6JXKTQ_M0), where the elbow is the fulcrum. Or, a shoulder can be modeled by a ball joint. 

Take a look at the demo simple machines, in particular, the pulley and the lever. These simplified models are clearly not the full picture of human motion, but they give us some intiution about how the body works. 

When thinking about humanoid robots, the design question often is whether we want to mimic the functionality of a human being, or the morphology, or both. For example, local exoskeleton company [Human In Motion](https://humaninmotion.com/) is trying to approximate normative human motion abilities, but they are not very worried about exact morphological match. Interestingly, local company [Red Rabbit Robotics](https://www.redrabbitrobotics.ai/) has a higher interest in matching morphology because they use motion capture systems to do remote robot control. [Santuary AI](https://www.sanctuary.ai/), on the other hand, has an interest in morphology likely because of marketing and investment reasons.

When making models for scientific purposes, we often want to simplify complexity so that we can make accurate predictions. With the advent of machine learning, the boundary between a model and a theory has started to become blurred. What do you think the difference is? Does it matter if a model isn't explainable?
