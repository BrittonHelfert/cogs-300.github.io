# Servo Sonar

## Introduction
In this activity, we'll be designing and prototyping a sonar device using the ultrasonic sensor and a servo. The purpose of this is to introduce grounded sensing. Eventually, we can apply a Bayes Filter to this as well, but for now, we'll just build the sonar device.

### Materials
- Paper and pens
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Servo
- Elastic bands
- Breadboard and jumper cables

## Activity
The basic idea will be to build up depth map of the robot's surroundings. The depth map is basically an "image" of the distance between your robot and the objects within the range of the ultrasonic sensor. 

### Create a depth map using just paper
To start, imagine that you've got a working ultrasonic sensor on a piece of paper. Mark where the ultrasonic sensor is. Draw or place objects for the ultrasonic sensor to which to measure distance.

Draw a small half-circle around the center of your ultrasonic. This will represent the angular range of your sonar (180Â° for the servo). Divide the half-circle in half a number of times to create the angular divisions that your
