# W10. Distribution 02
Today we will continue our discussion of networks and communication by applying our conceptual models to your Arduino-based robots. We will see that different parts of the "brain" of the robot can live in different places; in particular, on your computer. We will discuss the pros and cons of having some modules be dislocated from the robot's body.
