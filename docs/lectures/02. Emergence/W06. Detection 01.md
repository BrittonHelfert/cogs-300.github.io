# W06. Detection 01
Today we will learn about Bayes Theorem, and how to apply it to detection in robotics. It is foundational to many techniques in robotics from basic detection, to building complex machine learning classifiers.

At its core, Bayes Theorem is just a statement about conditional probability, which we learned about last time. The more information we know about a situation that a robot will find itself in, the more confident we can be about our predictions.

Our application area will be wall-following, in particular, trying to detect whether we're coming up to a corner. We'll integrate our prior knowledge about the corner with our observations of the robot's position to make a decision about where to go.
