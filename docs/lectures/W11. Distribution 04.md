# W11. Distribution 04
 Today we will learn about using other intelligent systems within robotic decision-making processes. We will see how it's possible to pipe robot input into an LLM and get back results that can be used to drive the robot. However, we will also see that latency and hallucinations do not make this a one-size-fits-all strategy.
