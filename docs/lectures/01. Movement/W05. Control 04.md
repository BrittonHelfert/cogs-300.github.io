# W05. Control 04
Today is an introduction to probability and predictions that are useful in control. Robots live in a probabilistic world, i.e., there is never 100% certainty about the correspondence between their model of the world, and the world itself. This is due to the presence of error: nothing is perfectly precise, therefore none of our models can be perfectly deterministic.

In many cases, as we saw with the threshold filter, "good enough" is good enough. But when it comes to long-term decision-making, errors accumulate, and then "good enough" quickly becomes "not very good at all."

Even if you have learned probability and statistics before, it's hard to figure out how to use probability in an application such as robotics. Today, we'll learn basic statistics and basic probability with applications to robotic control so that when we use it later, we have a solid foundation to build on.
