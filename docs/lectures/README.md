The [Schedule](/course-info/Schedule.md) outlines the technical topics that we will be learning, but it is just a rough overview. Lectures for this course will broadly follow the same pattern:
- A set of pre-readings (not strictly "pre" but it will certainly help to do ahead of time)
- A set of lessons and hands-on activities that we will follow during the lecture, with written summaries released after lecture
- Hand-written notes released after lecture
