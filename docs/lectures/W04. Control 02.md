# W04. Control 02
Last time, we talked about telemetry and localization. As you will find out in the labs, it's often hard to do localization with just the on-board sensors. It's still hard with external sensors, but they can give you another piece of the picture.

Today, we will look at the long-range distance sensor for this course, the [ultrasonic distance sensor](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/Isaac100/getting-started-with-the-hc-sr04-ultrasonic-sensor-7cabe1). Eventually, we will learn to reconcile the two different sensors (encoder and ultrasonic) through a process called sensor integration, but not today. Instead, we will just get used to the ultrasonic and the signal processing issues that come up with that sensor.

## Learning Goals
1. Learn how to wire and program an ultrasonic distance sensor.
2. Use ultrasonic distance sensors as a model for reasoning through any long-range sensing problem.
3. Describe the basic problem of noisy signals and apply simple signal processing approaches such as threshold filters.
