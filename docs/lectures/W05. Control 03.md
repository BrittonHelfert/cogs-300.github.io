# W05. Control 03
Maintaining distance from an object is both simple and hard. The basic problem is that you want to reduce error, i.e., get to the distance that you want to be at. But, because of the physics of real world, you don't always get exactly there.

That's where Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control comes in. It's a mathy-sounding name, but a pretty simple idea: if you're far away from the goal, drive faster. If you're close, drive slower. If you're there, stop.

Today we'll see how PID control can be used to maintain a distance from a wall. For the tournament, your robot will have to navigate a maze with walls, so this will set you up for the simplest effective solution for solving the maze.
