# COGS 300 Overview

## Overview
*Are computational intelligences like biological intelligences?*

Many things in nature make intelligent use of their environments. Many things seem to perform computations and make decisions based off of signals and information. In COGS 300, we consider the many forms of intelligence that exist in nature, and whether computational models can shed insight on how natural intelligence works. By building and programing an autonomous robot, we will learn about intelligence in all forms.
- We build physical robots to develop our intuitions about sensation, actuation, and intelligent decision-making.
- We look at intelligence from a complex systems science perspective, weaving together agent and environment.
- We learn about systems thinking, and the embedded, embodied, and extended approach to cognition.




## Approach

We use a very hands-on approach to learning. Be prepared to work creatively live during class. There is no room for sitting on your hands during class time, you are expected to fully participate. The focus is on teaching practical skills by working through design problems, often while drawing diagrams, building circuits, and writing code during class. Before each lecture, you should prepare by going over the readings and pre-class videos.

During class time, we will do hands-on design exercises, participate in demonstrations, and actively participate in demonstrations and lectures that explain the connection between electrical components, algorithms, and biological intelligent systems.

Assignments will be in the form of semi-weekly design challenges will consist of hand-drawn and annotated solutions to design problems. You will build a final personal electronic project. The requisite final exam will also be a design challenge.

To assist you in developing your design abilities, you will be required to maintain and hand in a physical sketchbook. Labs will consist of building working robotic systems in groups.

Finally, we will hold a robot tournament where groups face off to complete an obstacle course for best time.




## Commitment

As a 4-credit upper-year UBC course, COGS 300 is designed to be a difficult but rewarding class. Many of you will go from only having taken a little bit of computer science, to building fully-working autonomous robots in a few short months.

- You should expect to work extensively outside of class time building your robot.
- You will learn mathematical and computational models, and apply them creatively to design problems.
- You need to be prepared for active engagement with classmates and the teaching staff during lectures and labs.
- You will experience the joy (and frustration) of bringing something electronic to "life." It's worth it!

Sometimes people who are not in computer science face a conceptual barrier wherein they tell themselves that they are not technically competent enough to excel in robotics. However, our experience is exactly the opposite: often our TAs and top students are not computer science stream students, but are from psychology, linguistics and, yes, even philosophy. All of the skills we learn can be mastered by anyone who has made it this far in their degree. If you passed a computer science class and can handle cardboard and a glue gun, you'll do great.


## Why take the class?

There are a lot of good reasons to take COGS 300, even if you are not a COGS student:

- Robot components pervade all parts of your modern life, from cars to computers to door locks. You will learn how your world has been built.
- Artificial intelligence is now ubiquitous. You will learn the underpinnings of AI at an intuitive and practical level.
- Computational models of intelligence are sometimes good and sometimes bad models of natural biological intelligence. You'll be able to discern good and bad claims about computation and intelligence.
- It's fun. Making a robot is just plain fun.

The academic point of taking the class is that you will be able to use your hands-on, practical experience with robotics to reason about academic questions in all areas of cognitive systems and complex systems science (that includes social sciences). The job-readiness point of taking the class is that you will have experience on an electromechanical design team and two excellent portfolio pieces to demonstrate that. The world-readiness point of taking the class is that you will understand a lot more about how your day-to-day world operates.


## Course Materials

You will be required to purchase an Arduino R4 Wifi and a small set of electronics (Colleen, the COGS advisor will send a list including pickup instructions since we supposedly have some coming in at a discounted rate). You are required to have a physical sketchbook that you bring to lab and class. You will be required to purchase electronics for your personal electronics project (maximum $50 budget for the electronics project). We provide robot building materials, but batteries are not included, so you will need to negotiate with your team about how you will power your robot and likely purchase some rechargeable batteries.

There are no textbooks for this class, but weekly readings and instructions will be provided on the course website, which will be released during the first week of class.

### Required software:

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
- [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- [TinkerCAD](https://tinkercad.com/) (we will provide a free education account link during the first week)

### Arduino Kit pickup instructions

Cost recovery for lab kits: the exact price we'll be charging students is $47.50. We can't round up or down for the cost recovery, nor will Arts assist with acquiring float change...so it'd be great if students bring exact change. Students can also pay by cheque if that happens to be preferable.

Students can come to Colleen's office (basement of the Iona Building, 6000 Iona Dr) in the first week of class to exchange money for their lab kit. The following times currently will work for students to drop by:

- 9AM-3:30PM on Wednesday September 3rd (come just before/after the first Wednesday lab)
- 8:30AM-12:30PM on Friday September 5th (come just before/after first Friday lab)
- 9AM-3:30PM Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, September 8-10th


### Course Contacts

**Instructor**: Paul Bucci, paul.bucci@ubc.ca, Office: B138 in the Biodiversity Research Center (Beaty Museum lower floor)

**Office hours TBD** (likely Tue after class). Note that Paul does not check Canvas Inbox notifications often, nor does he check email outside of business hours.

We will release a Piazza page during the first week of school. That will be your main point of contact with TAs. For the most part, Paul will only be available via email and office hours.

You are highly encouraged to join the [COGS Discord](http://www.ubccogssoc.ca/resources.html), but no course announcements or teaching staff communication will happen through Discord. Paul is on the Discord (@phb), but doesn't really check it, and certainly has no access to the COGS 300 channel so can neither answer questions there nor see discourse about the course. We will be asking for course reps to take feedback from students, so the Discord is intentionally partitioned so that you can talk about the course without fear of being monitored by Paul. TAs may be on the COGS 300 channel at their own discretion, but Paul will never ask for a report on who is saying what.
