# Build a Popsicle Stick Industrial Robot

## Introduction
[Industrial robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_robot) often have the simple job of picking something up, then placing it down. These are called pick-and-place robots. You can think of them like [claw machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_machine) but for manufacturing.

Usually, there many different designs that can work for the same engineering [requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement). If all you care about is getting a product or component from one conveyer belt to another, you can probably come up with hundreds of different ways: dropping them, blasting them with air, vibrating them, or, using a pincer to pick them up and put them down. 

### Materials
- Popsicle sticks
- Clothes pins
- 3mm BBQ skewers
- Marbles or Ball bearings
- Hot glue gun
- Cardboard
- Lego (optional)
- Scissors

## Activity
In this activity, you will come up with an industrial marble-moving machine. Rather than *just* making it a [Rube Goldberg Contraption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine), we will think through the degress of freedom, mechanics, and engineering requirements. Although we'll be acting out the actuators, imagine that you are using real, electric motors to drive every mechanical movement.

### Requirements
You must design an industrial robot system that takes marbles (or ball bearings) from a container, conveys them along a distance of at least six inches (150mm), then are picked up and placed either in a container that is six or more inches away or another conveyor. You should use minimal human intervention, and only in the place of DC motors. The marbles should only be touched by popsicle sticks, cardboard or other craft materials. Every third marble should be placed in the bin.

### Plan your Robot
Before starting to build, mock up your robot by getting familiar with your materials, drawing, and making a design plan. Make sure everyone in your group is on the same page about the design. Don't get too caught up in building the perfect robot, the point of the plan is to help with analysis.

Plans are usually over-engineered. That's OK. It takes time to discover simple solutions. often the simplest designs took the most work. Plan for your plan to change.

### Build a Conveyor
One major job of industrial robot systems is to convey (move) a product from one place to another. A common solution is a conveyor belt, but also many other solutions are used. Build a system that conveys your mables from a container to a place that's at least six inches (150mm) away.

Plan ahead for this conveyor. You will need to think through the timing dynamics for your robot system. How and where will it control the rate of marbles?

### Build an End-effector
Your robot will need some way of picking up the marbles. An end-effector is a common robotics term for the part of the robot that goes on the *end* of a robotic system and has *effects* on materials, products, or other objects. In this case, your end-effector should be some kind of grabber, claw, or other picker-upper.

The end-effector will eventually have to be attached to another robotic system, so plan for the attachment point.

### Build an Ambulator, Track, Arm, and/or Gantry
Now that you can grab the marble, you need to move the robot to place it somewhere else. Common solutions for this are a robot that moves (ambulates) freely, a robot that drives along a track, an [articulated robot arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulated_robot), or a [gantry/cartesian system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_robot).

Each solution has benefits and drawbacks. Ambulation allows for free movement, but means that errors are easy to accumulate. Gantry systems are rigid and reduce error, but big and expensive.

Analyze your design in terms of the degrees of freedom. Lower isn't always better, but imagine that you do have to manage cost.

## On your own
You can model complex robotic systems with simple materials such as carboard and popsicle sticks. Sometimes, making a quick paper prototype is better than spending hours worrying over a CAD drawing. Good designers try to do the least amount of work to answer hard questions about their designs, have realizations about requirements, and fix bugs before doing expensive work. Usually, more low-cost prototypes make it less likely that the final product needs to be thrown out and rebuilt.

Take your pick-and-place robot and try to model as much of the mechanics as you possibly can. Note any places where you did a "hand wave" and didn't think through the design. Try to get your design to a point where you could actually estimate the cost of building the robot because you know enough about the design that you could start thinking about ordering parts.

## Philosophical Connection
Our bodies are full of both microscopic and macroscopic biological machines that convey materials from one place to another. Even though we can trace the origin of the philosophy to [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Man), far from being outdated, the mechanical model of the body can explain a large number of biological proceses better than the computational model. But the critique is that the mechanical model cannot account for subjectivity. Do you agree? Discuss.
