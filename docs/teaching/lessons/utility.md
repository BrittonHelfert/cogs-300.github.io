# Utility Matrices and Expected Value
When we talked about probability, we danced around a concept called [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value). Now, since we're talking about utility, we need to properly define it.

Let's go back to our dice games. If we have six people playing with one die, and the buy-in is $ \dollars 1$, then everyone should expect to win $\frac{1}{6}$ of the time. Your expected value per game is $\frac{1}{6} \times \$1.00$
