title: Lab 03. Build Your Own Bot
---

## Overview
[Link to Lab 03](/labs/lab03)

This lab is where students start building their robots that they'll use in the final tournament. The important part is to get them started with the debugging process. Encourage them to take it slow, make sure everything works, and then move onto the next step.


## Materials and Prep
Make sure the lab has enough robot components for 6-8 groups from your lab. 

You should be very confident with this part of the build. If you need to, build and tear down your robot a number of times. 

Prepare yourself for the post-mortems. The hardest part is making sure that everyone full engages with critique, both positive and negative. Don't let them get away with not doing the exercise. If they're stuck, ask critical questions like "Did you finish everything on time?" or "Did you feel you knew everything that you were responsible for?" etc.

## TODOs
1. Get them into their new groups. Explain the group work agreement. Explain that the teaching team is here to help them get along with each other, but we're somewhat ruthless when it comes to non-communication and lack of contribution. If someone isn't participating and hasn't worked things out with the group ahead of time, we'll just kick them out of the group or split it up in some other way. They're still responsible for fully completing the labs, just with fewer people now.
2. Explain the marking and post-mortem process that they'll be engaging in for all future labs. Essentially, they'll all need to say one thing that worked well, and one thing that didn't. They'll be asked questions about their engagement with the project (nicely). If someone isn't able to say how they contributed, that does endanger their mark for that lab (but again, say it nicely).
3. Point out the lab resources for building the chassis.
4. Go from group to group and ask them to explain their group agreement. If anything seems unclear, force them to sharpen it. For example, if they don't know where and when they're meeting, tell them to schedule a time and place right then and there (not during lab).
5. Remind everyone of that next week's handin is a robust testing framework, not just a working robot. They need to demonstrate that the robot works with a *plan*.

# Get into your robot groups
Start discussing your group work agreement until everything is settled. Then we'll explain the lab, then you can finish your agreement.

---
# Post-mortems and Lab Marks
Everything needs to be handed in the night before lab (so we can review and prepare for labs). Then we will do post-mortems:
- Everyone says one new thing that worked well about working together this week.
- Everyone says one new thing that didn't work well about working together.
- Everyone says how they contributed to the project.
We'll start post-mortems week after next. If people haven't contributed for non-honourable reasons, they may face consequences.

# Group Work Agreement
- Choose a meeting time outside of lab or lecture hours
- Determine a communication policy (e.g., response time, method)
- Agree on roles and responsibilities (everything can be renegotiated)
- Decide what to do when conflict arises

---
# The Teaching Team's Response to Conflict
Conflits happen. The best plan is to plan for conflict. Decide what to do right now, including consequences for non-communication and not taking responsibility. We can help people work out problems, but they have to want to work things out.

The teaching team will simply split up groups that cannot get along or work things out. People who do not communicate or contribute will be removed from a group. It is plagiarism to pass off group work as your own. All subgroups or individuals removed from groups are fully responsible for completing the lab work on their own.

# Chassis and Motor Build
Start by building the chassis and motor. You may want to create test and demo motor builds to ensure you can drive one motor at a time.

---
# Rigourous Test Suite
You are being marked on your ability to come up with a rigorous and creative way to demonstrate and test your robot's driving abilities. Think about it like planning for the future failure of your driving system.
