title: Lab 02. Paper Prototyping
---

## Overview
[Link to Lab 02](/labs/lab02)

This lab is an introduction to low-cost prototyping that is common in product design. There are a few important purposes to this lab:

1. It introduces the design ethos of design-by-prototype.
2. It sets the postive tone for brainstorming and other collaborative design.
3. It demonstrates to the non-computer scientists that they have something practical to contribute.

Essentially, anything that needs to be built can be effectively prototyped out of carboard. Anything we can't make work with carboard, we can act out. Making a "better" prototype means choosing the next thing we can't possibly make work with only cardboard and doing the minimum amount of work to get the next problem solved.

## Materials and Prep
Ensure that the lab has enough cardboard and craft supplies like glue, markers, and scissors. If you're low on cardboard, get some from a recycling bin nearby.

Familiarize yourself with the rules of Seven Things and practice on your own. You should be fast enough at Seven Things that you can confidently demonstrate to students how it work.

Familiarize yourself with the rules of Brainstorming. If you haven't brainstormed before, go through the exercises in the lab and brainstorm on your own or with other TAs. You should be able to help students when they get stuck on interface ideas by having a list prepared (either mentally or physically). *Don't give them answers*, but do be ready to give them a hint or a push in the right direction.

Remember that part of the learning process is being frustrated and stuck. Be emotionally prepared for students to be frustrated. You should only be helping them when they are very stuck, and even then, just point them in the right direction to figure it out themselves. This doesn't mean ignoring them or leaving them entirely to their own devices, but to engage socratically, i.e., with questions that will draw them closer to the answer themselves. 

For example, Seven Things can often be hard for first-timers, and it can feel very awkward waiting for someone to get it. They'll look at you with pleading eyes and want you to make it easy by giving them the answer. Don't. But if they're lost or distressed, you can say something like "What's the core rule of Seven Things? Every answer is correct!" or "Seven Things is about speed, not correctness!"

## TODOs

1. Demonstrate Seven Things and walk around while they are playing it. Encourage people and explain the rules kindly to those who are clearly not understanding.
2. Explain the brainstorm process. Tell them NOT to design until you say so. The hardest parts to understand are (1) that they are brainstorming interfaces, not interface designs, which means they are literally listing things that already exist and NOT designing; and (2) that they are NOT to critique and categorize (yet). Even if they want to just get started on the design, tell them to go through the practice of brainstorming.
3. Explain the different prototypes. They need to do one of each (work, feels, looks-like) in class, but their final prototype will be a mixture. 
4. Only now they're able to work on their final prototype and Wizard of Oz. It's hard to keep the discipline of this, so you'll probably have to go around and keep people on task.

# Paper Prototyping
Today, we will make user working interfaces with only cardboard and your Arduinos. 

---
# Groups
Over the next week, we will make final lab groups. Today is your last day to try working with someone new!

---
# Plan for the day
- Seven Things: getting used to not judging each other
- Brainstorm interfaces: gathering working material non-judgementally
- Brainstorm designs: categorizing and evaluating a direction
- Types of prototypes
- Wizard of Oz and working paper prototypes

---
# Seven Things
1. Get into groups of 5-7.
2. One person steps into the middle.
3. Another gives them an "anti-category"
4. They name something that "belongs" to the "anti-category"
5. Everyone claps and counts. Repeat up to seven things then clap and say "seven things" together.
6. Speed is the goal: there are absolutely NO wrong answers.

---
# Brainstorm interfaces
Write down as many intefaces as you possibly can in 5 minutes.
1. Get into groups of 3-4.
2. Choose a Leader and a Writer. The leader keeps the brainstorm live, the Writer writes everything down.
3. Write down as many interfaces as you can that use buttons, dials, switches, LEDs, etc. 
4. NO judgement, NO wrong answers, NO categorization.
5. You should be able to get 30-60 interfaces written down.

---
# Evaluate interfaces
You need to come up with a "new" idea for your product. Looking at your big list, start to choose what you want to prototype by doing the following:
1. Categorize similar interfaces.
2. Debate which are feasible to do in a week.
3. Rank which ones are interesting and fun.
4. Mix together ideas.
5. Tell the TA when you're ready to move on.

---
# First Prototypes
Make three prototypes in the next 10 minutes:
1. Looks-like prototype: shows what the prototype should look like.
2. Feels-like prototype: shows how the prototype should feel and mechanically operate.
3. Works-like prototype: shows a part of the system's functionality, e.g., an LED that turns on and off with a button.

---
# Wizard of Oz
Sometimes advanced functionality can be acted out, but not easily built. Decide which parts of your prototype work using code, and which parts you will have a "human computer" act out what it *would* do if you had the time to code it. 

---
# Working Prototype and Video
For next class, finish the prototype:
- One or more buttons or switches.
- One or more potentiometers or photocells.
- One or more LEDs or other Arduino-controlled display technologies.
- A coherent narrative and WoZ script
Submit a video the night before the lab.
