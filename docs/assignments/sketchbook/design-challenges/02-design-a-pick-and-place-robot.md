# Design a Pick-and-Place Robot
Building on the design challenge we did in class, design a "working" prototype of a Pick-and-Place robot. A pick-and-place robot does what it sounds like: it picks something up, and it places it elsewhere.

The constraints are the same as in class:
- The robot operates in a room about the size of the classroom
- The robot must be mechanically plausible
- There is an input conveyer belt, and an output conveyer belt
- There are two bins that can be placed anywhere
- The robot must sort objects from the input conveyer into both bins and the conveyer belt

You should build a real, physical "working" prototype of the robot. You can use any crafting material: Lego, popsicle sticks, paper, hot glue, etc. You do not need to use any electronic parts. You should also make drawings in your sketchbook that match the physical design and explain how it works.

When you submit your design, account for all of the details of the operation of the robot in your sketchbook. We should be able to reasonably "run" your prototype without you explaining it to us in person. The prototype itself does not need to be handed in, but we will gladly accept demonstrations in person or via video on Piazza.


## Design solution format and handin

You should draft your design solution in your sketchbook so that we can talk about it when we consult your sketchbook. You should draft before you present a final set of photos to us.

Make a presentable, clean version in your sketchbook, reflect on the module and your learning, justify and give yourself a grade from 0-5. Upload a photo of your reflection and presentable version of the design challenge for review. Also upload enough photos that we can reasonably understand how your prototype was actually built.

The reflection should be a paragraph or two on the course concepts, tying them into your personal understanding of the course. Include a short justification for the mark that you've given yourself in terms of your participation in class, engagement with the readings, and work on the design challenge.

The design challenge is due about two weeks after the assignment released (will be indicated on Canvas).
