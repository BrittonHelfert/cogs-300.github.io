# Introduction Module: Estimate a Building
For this design challenge, you are being asked to estimate the size of a building. You are not restricted from using some conventional measuring tools, but this is an exercise in estimation, so you are not required to be correct in your measurement, just close. Do not put yourself in danger to measure anything, i.e., don't climb anything or hang out of a window, etc.

- Choose a building on UBC campus to estimate the size of. The building must be at least three storeys.
- Make an accurate scale diagram of the outline of the building from at least two perspectives (front and side). 
- Include major architectural details such as roofs, windows, doors, eaves, courses, etc. at scale.
- Annotate your drawing with your scale, units, measurements, and the methodology for estimation. Include a description of your error estimation and calculations of lower and upper bounds for measurements.

You do not have to make a very pretty drawing, but you should make reasonably accurate estimates. You can use reference photographs, but do not include the photographs in the finished drawing. It's fine to use digital drawing tools, but highly encouraged to try on paper first.


## Design solution format and handin

You should draft your design solution in your sketchbook so that we can talk about it when we consult your sketchbook. You should draft before you present.

Make a presentable, clean version in your sketchbook, reflect on the module and your learning, justify and give yourself a grade from 0-5. Upload a photo of your reflection and presentable version of the design challenge for review.

The reflection should be a paragraph or two on the course concepts, tying them into your personal understanding of the course. Include a short justification for the mark that you've given yourself in terms of your participation in class, engagemnt with the readings, and work on the design challenge.

The design challenge is due two weeks after the assignment released (will be indicated on Canvas).
