title: Lab 08. Line-following
draft: true
---
This is the last lab with new content before the tournament. Everything else is directly tournament prep. Today, we will be learning how to do line-following. You will have two options for the final tournament: photocells and IR sensors. Today, we will implement the photocell version. IR sensors are often more precise, but they give binary outputs, so they are less adaptable. As with everything, there are design tradeoffs for the equipment you use.
