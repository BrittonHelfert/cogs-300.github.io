title: Lab 03. Build Your Own Bot
---

For this lab, we will walk you through building the first version of your robot. You will add to this basic design for the rest of the term, slowly improving it until the eventual robot tournament, where you will compete against all other teams for the best times through an obstacle course.

For today, however, you will just build the robot's chassis and drive system. You may decide to build multiple versions of your robot, so if your team would like to build two in parallel, feel free to do that. You will likely have to rebuild your robot from scratch more than once, so do not plan to make this the final design.

We suggest using a modular approach to building the robot. Rather than trying to make the whole system work together all at once, build the smallest possible part of the system you can, test it thoroughly, and then proceed to the next stage. Plan to test, plan to rebuild, plan for failure, and you will succeed.
