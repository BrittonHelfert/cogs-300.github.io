title: Lab 10. Build Your Own Tournament and Demo Day
draft: true
---
You now get a chance to build your own tournament. Each lab will be responsible for building one section of the tournament. The Wednesday lab will build the line-following challenge, the Friday lab will build the wall-following challenge, and the Monday lab will build the object-tracking challenge.

There are design considerations for the tournament itself. For example, last year, the line-following challenge was won by people who decided not to follow the lines at all, but take a chance on trying to find the beginning of the maze by a straight-shot. It was allowed because there wasn't a good way to penalize leaving the lines without penalizing "legitimate" attempts to follow the line as well.

Therefore, we would suggest making the line-following challenge complex enough that this would be difficult. Or, we could implement areas that need to be driven over by the robot to consider the challenge complete. It's up to the Wednesday lab entirely to figure this out.

Similarly, one year we had a very difficult fork in the wall-following challenge that made everyone need to design their robots to have sensors on both sides, or take a chance. The next year, a different fork was implemented and it was not a problem. These things will evolve. It's up to the Friday lab entirely to figure this out.

This is an exercise in distributed democracy. Think through the different ways people could game the system, and design against it.

## Demo Day
You will bring a working demonstration of your project to this lab. It does not have to be complete, but there does have to be at least some working components that can be viewed and critiqued.
