title: Lab 09. Model Tournament
---

The tournament will consist of three major challenges: (1) Line-following; (2) Wall-following; and (3) Object tracking. In today's lab, you will perform each of these, but on a small scale. The important part to practice will be the transitions between challenges. 

The rules for the tournament are simple: your robot must be entirely autonomous, use only equipment available in lab or that reasonably would be available to everyone, and complete each challenge fairly individually as well as overall. We reserve the right to ban any technique or equipment, so check if you're unsure.

The tournament is for speed and the prize is bonus marks. You may have as many time-trials as will fit into your lab, but everyone needs a fair chance to retry. Every time you touch, signal, or otherwise interact with your robot will be a 1-minute penalty above and beyond any time you spend with the robot. If you move your robot, you cannot gain any distance with your movement (reorientation is OK).

The reason we have the time penalty for touching/interacting is that sometimes robots get stuck, and teams don't want to restart their run. Or, sometimes teams want to upload new code to their robot in the middle of the run. Although that clearly reduces the autonomy of the robot, the reality is that no robot in real life is truly fully autonomous.

We will give out prizes for the top speeds in each challenge, as well as overall. There will be a final tournament with the top teams from each lab. That means that there are five categories in which you can win a bonus mark.

It is not always the case that the same teams get all the bonus marks. Sometimes, one team excels at one challenge, and does poorly on another challenge. In that case, they will get bonus marks for the challenge they excel at (if they are the fastest).

This year, since our Arduinos have Bluetooth and Wifi capabilities, you *can* run an AI system on your computer and send commands to your robot. However, the system must still be strictly autonomous and every human command will incur a 1-min penalty.

### 1. Create and use a model line-following challenge
First in the tournament will be line-following. If there is not already an available line-following model, create your own using piece of white tape. Think through the major problems you will encounter in a line-following challenge: straight sections, inside corners, outside corners, curves, etc. Create a model of each, either all together, or separated. Make sure your robot can overcome each problem.

### 2. Create and use a model wall-following challenge
Next in the tournament will be wall-following. If there is not already an available wall-following model, create your own using pieces of cardboard. Think through the major problems you will encounter in the wall-following challenge: straight sections, inside corners, outside corners, curves, etc. Create a model of each, either all together, or separated. Make sure your robot can overcome each problem.

### 3. Create and use a model object-tracking challenge
Last in the tournament will be object-tracking. There will be a randomly positioned object within a taped-off arena. You will need to find and touch the object to end the tournament. If there is not already an available object-tracking model. Think through the major problems you will encounter in the object-tracking challenge, including being pointed towards the object initially, being pointed away, missing the object and hitting the white tape of the arena, going in circles, etc. Make sure your robot can overcome each problem.

### 4. Switch between robot modes (homework)
Now we can put the challenges together. You will need to figure out a method for transitioning between challenges. We will have special markers that can help you determine the beginning or end of a challenge, as demonstrated in the TA model tournament. Create your own model transistions.
