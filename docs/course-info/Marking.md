# Marking
A majority of your mark is dependent on active participation, peer, and self-evaluation. Attendance is mandatory and will be checked, participation is also mandatory and will be evaluated both by course staff and peers.

## Final Exam (5%)
Apparently, we have to give you one. It's 5% because that's the minimum that made sense. It will consist of design challenges just like the ones we have in class.

## Sketchbook (25%)
You will be required to maintain a physical, hand-written sketchbook. Your sketchbook should be a record of your creative engagement with the course. Every module (about every two weeks), you'll be required to hand in a reflection on the module and a design challenge that responds to the core concepts. The design challenge will be an expansion of one of our class activities guided by our do this "on your own" suggestions given during or after the activities.

Importantly, you will **give yourself a grade from 0-5** for these:
- 5: You went above and beyond, engaging with many of the readings, doing outside research to complete the design challenge, attending and participating fully in class.
- 4: You completed the design challenge, did one or two of the readings, and participated reasonably well in class.
- 3: You completed the design challenge, at least glanced at the readings, and attended class.
- 2: You completed the design challenge, are vaguely aware of the readings, and attended class.
- 1: You attempted the design challenge, handed in what you got, aren't really sure what the readings are, and showed up late to class.
- 0: You either didn't do the design challenge or didn't come to class.

We will do a pass to ensure that your grade is indeed commensurate with your work and aligns with our attendance and participation records. We reserve the right to scale your grade based on our observations. That being said, most people get the grade they give themselves here.

The **reflection** should be a paragraph or two on the course concepts, tying them into your personal understanding of the course. Include a short justification for the mark that you've given yourself in terms of your participation in class, engagemnt with the readings, and work on the design challenge.

You will also be required to document your development of your personal project ideas. It's a sketchbook, so the documentation is allowed to be sketchy. You should be regularly using the sketchbook to work out ideas. It doesn't need to "look" good, sketchy in a sketchbook is good!

## Labs (35%)
The core of the course is the labs. You will be mostly working with a group to complete an autonomous robot that navigates an obstacle course. Lab attendance is absolutely mandatory, but participation outside of scheduled lab time will also be necessary. UBC recommends you spend 2-3 hours per hour of class studying: you should expect to be spending that time in the lab working on your robot or personal project.

You will be marked on a 0-5 scale for labs:

- 5: Exceptional demonstration of lab concepts (exceeds requirements)
- 4: Good demonstration of lab concepts (meets requirements)
- 3: Reasonable demonstration of lab concepts (one or two requirements unclear)
- 2: Missing one or two lab concepts
- 1: Missing most lab concepts
- 0: No attendance/no completion.

Exceeding requirements means that you do more than you are explicitly told to do. You don't need to go absolutely wild with this, but you do need to exceed the basic outline. Normally, we will tell you how you can possibly exceed requirements. The point of this is to get you into a creative zone outside of what we can dictate.

## Personal project (35%)
The personal project will be a creative electronics project that you take on yourself. It is the individual assessment of the course that (largely) replaces the final exam. You will use it to demonstrate your mastery over basic mechatronics as taught in this course and to make a connection to course concepts of cognitive systems and intelligence. 


## A note on the pedagogical approach
By and large, we are taking inspiration from the "ungrading" movement. That is to say, the point of grading in this course is to keep everyone on track with learning outcomes, and to provide a way to evaluate mastery over skills. So, although we do "grade" a bit, we would prefer to spend teaching time teaching. Similarly, we prefer you spend your study time developing practical skills drawing, building, discussing, and testing. We believe that anyone who fully participates will reasonably master the subject, so our grading is essentially oriented towards that.
